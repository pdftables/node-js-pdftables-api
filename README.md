# node.js PDFTables.com API example

This uses the [request](https://github.com/request/request) module to
simplify HTTP access.

It uploads a file called `example.pdf` and saves the output as a single
Excel spreadsheet called `output.xlsx`.

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the URL variable of the source with an API key
that you've obtained from [the PDFTables.com API
page](https://pdftables.com/API).
